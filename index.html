                <h2>The story of me, a woman trying to bring the monies back</h2>
               <p>Not much had happened lately in her life. With 
                   the two bootcamps that she was doing and the slight
                    knee pain she was feeling, it seems fun times were
                     near null. But, happily she had accepted that
                      sedentary life, nobody would get in between 
                      a lady with will and her career goals. 
            </p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-2">
                <p>Was she scared? Yes. Was she having no sex life? 
                    That too. Was she like an alien to the world of 
                    partying and traveling where she was supposed to 
                    fit in by being far from what had been home for 
                    11 years? For sure. Did she miss hiking in Northern
                     California? Absolutely. But, what was there to do, 
                     giving up? Enough said, never happening.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-3">
                <p>As she thought and thought more about how isolating 
                    and how tight her budget was under this process, 
                    she figured enjoyment will come later. One day, 
                    she will finally weep her tears with 100 dollar bills
                     and have that debt swoop by her own merit, she would
                      resume hoping place to place as a digital nomad and
                       renew her spirits under a better work environment.</p>
